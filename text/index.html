        <h1>THE 9 TITAN SHAPE SHIFTERS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>The Founding Titan</strong>: The Founding Titan is a titan that has the power to control and coordinate
            the actions,biology, memory etc of all the other titans as well as all the subjects of Ymirs (Eldians).</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Eren Jaegar</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Attack Titan</strong>: Made to oppose the self-righteousness of the Founding Titan, the Attack 
            Titan has the power to inherit the memories of its future inheritors. It leads the frontline in war times.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Eren Jaegar</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Armoured Titan</strong>: Covered by a hardened armour, the Armoured Titan has incredible 
            mobility and its armour can withstand many of the explosive weapons used by the enemies.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Reiner Braun</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Colossal Titan</strong>: Towering over 60 m tall, with the ability to transform with the force
            of an atomic bomb, the massive Colossal Titan ejects hot steam from its body which can melt any person within seconds
            of exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Armin Arlett</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Female Titan</strong>: The Female Titan has the ability to mimic the powers of the other titans
            . Its call can attract other pure titans to her location. She also has the ability to harden certain parts of her exoskeleton.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Annie Leonhart</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Jaw Titan</strong>: The smallest and the most agile among the 9 titans, its mouth and jaws are covered
            by hardened titan skin and can even break hardened titan crystals by the sheer force of its jaws.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Falco Grice</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Beast Titan</strong>: The Beast Titan can take the form of any animal based upon who its inheritor
             is. <em>Note</em>: All the special powers that Zeke's Beast Titan has are because of his physical prowess and his royal
            blood. In no way are they related to the Beast Titan.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Zeke Jaegar</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The Cart Titan</strong>: The Titan with the longest endurance to remain in its titan form, the Cart Titan is
            a quadrupled and perfect for the transportation of weapons and ammunitions for war.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Piecke Finger</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>The War Hammer Titan</strong>: The War Hammer Titan has the ability to conjure weapons by using its 
            hardening property. It is also unique in the fact that the Eldian who transforms into the War Hammer Titan does not reside
            in the Titan's nape, rather it is safe in a titan crystal connected to the main body through an umbilical cord.</p>
            <p><strong>Current Inheritor</strong>: Eren Jaegar</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
